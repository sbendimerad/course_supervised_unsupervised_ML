    "\n",
    "Most of the data that Data Scientists is usually quantitative (stock price, revenue etc.) or qualitative (Color, gender etc.). With NLP, we deal with whole corpus of text and we need to somehow translate that into numbers so that computers can understand it. This comes with a set challenges to keep in mind: \n",

    "  * Language is an ambiguous mode of expression. The same word, sentence or text can have completely different interpretations. Generations of researchers continue to be interested in works, quotations and even simple words, so rich is the richness of language interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Interpretation of language depends on situational context, the surrounding real world, common sense, and cultural and social norms.\n",
